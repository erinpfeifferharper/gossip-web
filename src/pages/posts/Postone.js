        <h4>My thoughts on the revision videos:</h4>
        <p>
          When engaging with the revision videos, the lecture video took us
          through what is art, what is the internet and what us internet/web
          art. From this as someone who has been in this degree for almost four
          years now, it has allowed me to see how difficult it can be to define
          what art is and what it is not. What I picked up from the lecture
          video is how everyone (there were only a few people that spoke) had
          their own interpretation on art, where it is used, what classifies
          something as art. From what Hanli mentioned that stood out to me is
          that art can be defined by Intentionality, Meaning and Interpretation.
          The lecture videos do a good job at explaining what is internet art
          and providing some technical examples however, I am still a bit
          confused on this matter, however, I intend to conduct further research
          in the hopes of understanding what internet art is.

        <h4>Technical questions on this week's work:</h4>
        <p>
          As this was our first week engaging in the code of ReactJs, I did not
          have many questions regarding the work we were doing, however I did
          have some feedback on how I felt engaging with the activities. I found
          them to be quite challenging, as ReactJs utilises JS(JavaScript) which
          I know is something I have struggled in the past with, so I hope that
          by the near future I am able to create my projects and tasks
          accordingly. I have decided to purchase a course on Udemy as well to
          help upskill some of my JS skill and help with my ReactJs skills,
          hopefully it will help. The technical questions I do have can be seen
          as the following:{" "}
          <li>What is the difference between JS and JSX file in VS Code?</li>
          <li>When do I use JS or JSX?</li>
        </p>
        <h4>
          My impression of net/web art; what interests me, which works do I
          like, what you don't I like:
        </h4>
        <p>
          My first impressions of internet/web art were that it is basically art
          that is on the internet, however it is not just displaying art as it
          is something that you interact with as well. The example that I really
          liked was ‘exhausting a crowd’, for I thought it was amazing how you
          can add text to the video being displayed and, in a way, it creates a
          story, as others added what people, inanimate objects were thinking,
          saying, etc. In terms of disliking internet art, I don’t think I
          disliked any however, there were ones that confused me that I just did
          not engage with as I was not attracted to them.
        </p>
        <h4>My thoughts on the readings:</h4>
        <p>
          In the reading, it focused on Adobe Flash. Adobe Flash was a
          multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich
          internet applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile
          games, and embedded web browser video players, however, it is sad to
          note that it has been discontinued. At first, I honestly did not know
          how much information about the early internet it had, let alone what
          it was. For when I started creating games, I searched for the site in
          which I used to play my childhood games, however, some could not work
          as it stated some Adobe Flash error, which I did not think much of
          until now engaging in the readings. It is sad to know that some of my
          childhood experiences in terms of games and other stuff on the
          internet may never be accessed again unless hacked or made available
          on sites dedicated to internet art.
