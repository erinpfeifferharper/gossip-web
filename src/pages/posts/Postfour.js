        <h4>Critical Analysis Essay: Form Net Artwork</h4>
        <p>
          The way we view and engage with art has been profoundly changed by the
          internet, which provides an infinite canvas for artistic expression
          beyond the limitations of conventional media. With the development of
          the internet, a new age of invention and innovation has begun in the
          ever-changing field of artistic expression, known as net/web art. When
          artists discovered that the internet might be a helpful medium for
          promoting their work without being constrained by social, political,
          or cultural norms, net art began to take shape in the 1990s (Internet
          Art, no date). Internet art, sometimes referred to as net art, can be
          seen as art that is ‘made on and for the internet’ (Internet Art, no
          date). This includes a variety of computer-based art subgenres, such
          as software art and browser art. Using the internet as both a canvas
          and a medium, net/web art has become innovative art form that
          questions conventional ideas about audience participation and
          artistry. With the above in mind, I will be focusing on a piece of
          net/web art in this critical analysis, by exploring its technical,
          artistic, and conceptual aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The net/web art that I will be discussing is a piece by Russian artist
          Alexei Shulgin titled ‘Form’ (Shulgin, 1997), this piece was
          established in 1997 (Form Art, no date). At first glance when one is
          presented with this net/web art, one would think the piece is blank or
          missing information, however that is merely how it is constructed. In
          the piece the artist explores the use of HTML (HyperText Markup
          Language) buttons, menus, and checkboxes as its primary material for
          the net/web art (Seu, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
          With his clever repurposing, he creates elaborate monochrome
          compositions that subvert and question our traditional perceptions of
          the physicality and purpose of the internet. The purposeful use of
          monochromatic draws attention to the glaring simplicity of the web's
          fundamental elements while simultaneously encouraging reflection on
          the underlying complexity they represent. The lack of colour
          highlights how basic HTML components are, making us wonder about the
          deep intricacy they stand for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, Shulgin explores the possibilities of using technology and
          the internet to produce art, emphasizing the significance of digital
          components while challenging the conventional notion of art. This work
          challenges the audience to reconsider conventional ideas about content
          and aesthetics in the internet space. Furthermore, when you look at
          the main site of Shulgin now, the basic HTML forms on the website no
          longer serve any purpose, enabling their look to be emphasized and
          repurposed in a confusing web of forms and linkages (Shulgin,
          1997)which makes it difficult for users to engage with as they are
          unaware of what pages work and do not work. For when I explored this
          myself, certain selects take you to a 404-error page.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have established what net art is, along with some context
          regarding the selected net/web artwork to analyse, let us dive into
          this critical analysis by focusing on our key three points being,
          technical, artistic, and conceptual aspects. To begin, let us look at
          the technical aspects of the work. As stated above ‘Form’ can be seen
          to showcase the artists use of HTML elements throughout this net/web
          art page. For he embraces the inherent malleability of digital code
          and surpasses the constraints of traditional creative media by deftly
          modifying the basic building elements of the internet. This can be
          seen in the way the artist organises the various forms, buttons,
          checkboxes, etc. in unconventional ways, as they are all transformed
          into interactive art installations while allowing some interactive
          experiences – this can be seen by clicking the ‘Gomputer Game’ which I
          feel should state ‘Computer Game’ as that would make much more sense,
          unless it is what the artist intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page is the second page the user goes into after clicking any
          button in the word ‘Form’ written across the screen (NET ART
          ANTHOLOGY, 2016) Additionally when interacting with the page there are
          parts of dynamic content, such as mini animations of people, animals,
          cars, objects such as candles all utilising the basic elements of
          HTML. Thus highlighting how the piece embraces the inherent
          malleability of digital code. These animated shorts invite the
          audience to immerse themselves in a universe where the boundaries
          between art, technology, and interactivity are constantly being
          redefined. They are not only ornamental pieces; rather, they are
          essential components of the total creative experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on to the aesthetics, it can be seen to embrace a minimalist
          approach, as there are hardly any styling elements such as colour used
          within it. There is a monochromatic palette being utilised. Through
          questioning the differences between two seemingly unrelated domains,
          Shulgin's work challenges the audience to reevaluate the fundamental
          essence of art and technology. Shulgin successfully blurs the lines
          between form and function and art and technology by bringing even the
          most mundane and functional aspects of the web to the level of
          aesthetic expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However although wanting to go minimalistic, there is no sense of
          consistency throughout this net/web art, for we know when analysing a
          website, consistency throughout the site is important, as it allows
          users to have a sense of familiarity with the interfaces, making it
          much easier to use (UXPin, 2020). However, in this instance that is
          not the case, reason being the information displayed very minimalistic
          – basically it is little to nothing. Furthermore, as the above
          mentioned is the typical convention in which information should be
          displayed consistently, it can be that Shulgin’s work intentionally
          subverts from this, to challenge the viewers expectations along with
          preconceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shulgin successfully eliminates the visual clutter and distractions
          that frequently accompany standard websites by providing a minimalist,
          almost arid design, enabling the spectator to interact with the work
          on a more intellectual and sensory level. In this way, the
          inconsistency turns into a purposeful tactic to break the audience's
          feeling of familiarity and promote a more thoughtful, investigative
          approach to the artwork. Furthermore, the inconsistency throughout the
          piece may be seen as a mirror of the internet's natural fluidity and
          ongoing change. The world of net art is one in which limits and
          expectations are always being redefined and questioned, in contrast to
          traditional creative forms, which frequently follow set rules and
          procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delving into the conceptual aspects of ‘Form’ it is clear to see that
          it highlights the intersection of art, technology, and the world,
          providing a critical analysis of the bureaucratic aspects of the
          internet while simultaneously highlighting its creative possibilities.
          As far back as the internet's founding, technology has been present
          and has had a significant influence on digital art. Artists perceived
          this new technology as a canvas that might allow them to express
          themselves creatively and break free from the constraints of
          conventional art forms, and they soon realized this. As artists can
          work with pixels, construct intricate algorithms, and produce amazing
          visual effects that are exclusive to the digital media by using code
          (Ricci, no date)
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique is therefore utilised in Shulgin work. Through his
          manipulation of HTML elements, which include forms, checkboxes, and
          buttons, he effectively turns these functional components into
          creative expressions. These building blocks of the internet are what
          make up the internet. Shulgin's artistic output serves as an
          illustration of how technology may be used creatively. Through his
          manipulation of the internet's basic components, he has produced
          interactive art that questions our relationship to technology. His
          work serves as a reminder of the innovative and creative ways in which
          technology may be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the above in mind let us look at the characteristics of what
          net/web art is and where they can be analysed in this work. Media
          theorist and curator Tilman Baumgärtel lists "connectivity, global
          reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity…”as traits of net
          art, with the internet and the socio-cultural changes it brought about
          serving as a common theme (Internet Art, no date)
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we look at the selected net/web art it is clear to see that
          all the characteristics listed above can be found within the page. Let
          us discuss them. Connectivity and Global Reach: I have decided to
          place these two characteristics as they go hand in hand with one
          another. The work demonstrates these two characteristics by using the
          internet as It main medium while inviting user to interact, when it
          comes to users it is essentially anyone with internet connect that can
          access this piece, therefore reaching people globally. Furthermore,
          allowing users to experience and participate in the artwork regardless
          of their current location.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            Multimediality: This showcases that the net/web art does not consist
            of one medium for it to be produced and function, as in incorporates
            multiple mediums such as HTML code, the buttons, forms, checkboxes,
            etc. that creates the composition of the artwork.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immateriality: Because the net/web art is fleeting and short-lived,
            it is a prime example of this, as the artwork challenges
            conventional ideas of materiality in art since it is a digital
            construct that only lives in virtual space and is susceptible to
            change and modification over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactivity: Is seen as the central part of the net/web art as
            every aspect of it requires you to interact with it, even though you
            as the user may not know what exactly to press or what to do, the
            sole purpose is that you interact with it.{" "}
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, to provide my own thoughts on this piece of net/web art,
          I think it was quite a unique and different way to go about it. As
          someone who enjoys looking at minimal websites in general, this is
          what stood out to me about this website, although at first it was
          quite confusing after navigating through the page, I managed to
          understand what some of the features do/entail.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a part within the net/web art where I could create enter a
          word, in a form and it would display using checkboxes, dots, forms or
          a combination of it all. I was able to manipulate certain aspects that
          would cause certain patterns or animations to appear on the screen,
          which I think is a fun and creative way to go about the internet. From
          seeing what the page is about then looking at the title of the page,
          it is clear to see that it means exactly what it says which is ‘Form’
          – for there are multiple forms on the page and they are all
          interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, with the above stated information, it is clear to see
          that Shulgin’s work is regarded as a foundational piece in the field
          of net/web art, demonstrating the genre's capacity to reinvent,
          question, and rethink our conception of artistic expression in the
          digital era, through its conceptual, aesthetic and technical aspects
          for it urges us to embrace the internet's ability to influence,
          inspire, and question our perceptions while also encouraging critical
          engagement with the medium. Therefore, Shulgin's work is a great
          illustration of how online art can question our digital world and push
          the limits of artistic expression.
