        <h4>My thoughts on the revision videos:</h4>
        <p>
          In the revision videos, one of them was a lecture that I was a part of
          an engaged in, through which it covered ‘Interaction and www’, in this
          Interaction was discussed and how it can be seen on the www (hence the
          title). With this, I feel that this revision video ties in with what
          was said in the previous week about internet art, that for it to be a
          form of internet art there needs to be some sort of interaction taking
          place. All this can be found in the various user interface events one
          using in HTML.

        <h4>Technical questions on this week's work:</h4>
        <p>
          In this week we were introduced to State, State Management, Lifecycles
          and Routing. I did not have many questions regarding the technical
          aspect of this week. The technical questions I do have can be seen as
          the following:
          <li>What is React Router Dom?</li>
          <li>What do we use it for?</li>
          <li>What is State? How and when to use it?</li>
        </p>
        <h4>
          My brainstorming, research, and references for your internet artwork:
        </h4>
        <p>
          As for our third assignment and final exam, we needed to brainstorm,
          research and reference internet artworks, however in this week, I was
          unable to come up with an idea of what I would like to incorporate in
          my internet artwork, however with exploring I was able to find a few
          internet artworks that I found to be amazing, they are the following:
          <li>Form Art by Alexei Shulgin, 1997</li>
          <li>Death Imitates Language by Harm van den Dorpel, 2016</li>
          <li>Exhausting a Crowd by Kyle McDonald, 2015</li>
          <li>Keeping up Appearances by Mendi Obadike, 2001</li>
          <li>Image Atlas by Taryn Simon with Aaron Swartz, 2012</li>
          From these artworks, as they are all different, to provide a summary
          of the aspects I enjoyed from them can be seen in minimalism, colours,
          the interactivity, a technique I never saw possible. These aspects do
          not apply to all of them, certain aspects work with certain websites.
        </p>
        <h4>My thoughts on internet/web/net art:</h4>
        <p>
          When it comes to internet art, what I would say I see as a core
          element is interactivity, which is what I mentioned in my thoughts on
          the revision videos, the web utilising interactivity as its core
          element, allows for a more engaging and immersive experience with the
          artwork, as it is not just displaying art on the internet.
          Furthermore, this can be accessed by anyone who has access to the
          internet, each coming from a diverse background that shows how art can
          be interpreted and used by a variety of people.
