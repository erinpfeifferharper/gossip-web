        <h4>My thoughts on my progress and development using React:</h4>
        <p>
          When it comes to my progress in using React, I would say that I am at
          a place where I never thought I would be before, as I am starting to
          understand why I need to use certain elements/functions. What I feel
          really helped me in this, is the Udemy course I started as well. I
          know for the sake of time - only having one semester of Interactive
          Media this year, we were not able to go as in-depth with React, which
          is what this course does, it allowed me to think and understand the
          work we were doing in class in a different manner. My development in
          React has also improved, as I am currently working on my assignment
          three website, it is a bit tricky to do certain things as was with the
          second assignment, but I managed to get there. I would say the only
          thing that is making me think a lot is how I will use React JS to
          create my internet artwork for my final exam, as I have seen amazing
          internet artworks that have been shared with us or internet artworks
          that I have researched in preparation for my artwork. I will further
          link this into my next point to discuss.
        </p>
        <h4>My ideas, inspirations, or prep work for my internet artwork:</h4>
        <p>
          One internet artwork, that I came across as it was shared with us in
          the discussions tab was the internet artwork on the Girls Who Code
          website, which is where you can customise your own character,
          particularly a female character, as there is a lack of representation
          of female characters in the game space and this was their purpose of
          their internet artwork. After seeing this work, I feel that my
          internet artwork will not live up to this standard. When it comes to
          my internet artwork, I have been conducting some research as I have
          struggled to find some ideas that correlate to my theme or that is
          something I would enjoy creating, even if it does not relate to the
          theme whatsoever. This will also be further discussed in my section on
          the webpage dedicated to internet art research, so please do check it
          out.

        <h4>My thoughts on the theme of AI and Art</h4>
        <p>
          When it comes to my thoughts on the theme AI and Art, I think it has a
          lot that one can take from it, such as it being a new way to
          convey/display art, which calls for more interactive pieces that can
          be seen to challenge the way the audience engages with the artwork
          compared to the traditional ways of which art was previously engaged
          in with. Furthermore, I think it works well to display important
          information but in a more simplistic and aesthetically pleasing way â€“
          that will allow people to become more aware of it as they are able to
          grasp it easily, which I feel links into how we displayed our data art
          in our project last year, simple but informative and to a certain
          extent interactive.
